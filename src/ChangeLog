	* added ChangeLog
	* bumped version number for plugin to 0.4.2
	* Fixed NPE in ctrl-space for VHDL files. 
	* renamed build.xml to buildjavacc.xml. The original build.xml file
	  is used to generate .java from .jj files. The "build.xml" name
	  is used by standard Eclipse naming w.r.t. build files for exporting
	  the plugin
	* added standard Eclipse build.xml which allows exporting veditor
	  as a plugin
