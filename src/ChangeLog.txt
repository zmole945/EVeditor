	* added ChangeLog
	* bumped version number for plugin to 0.4.2
	* Fixed NPE in ctrl-space for VHDL files. 
	* renamed build.xml to buildjavacc.xml. The original build.xml file
	  is used to generate .java from .jj files. The "build.xml" name
	  is used by standard Eclipse naming w.r.t. build files for exporting
	  the plugin
	* added standard Eclipse plugin.xlm, which produces an emphemeral build.xml 
	  which allows exporting veditor as a plugin
