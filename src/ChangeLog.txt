	* added ChangeLog
	* bumped version number for plugin to 0.4.2
	* Fixed NPE in ctrl-space for VHDL files. 
	* renamed build.xml to buildjavacc.xml. The original build.xml file

	  the plugin
	* added standard Eclipse plugin.xlm, which produces an emphemeral build.xml 
	  which allows exporting veditor as a plugin
